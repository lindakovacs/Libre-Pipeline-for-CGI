Libre Pipeline for CGI is a personal project of nelson gonçalves (aka nafergo).

This directory was created with the purpose of sharing Free/Libre and Open Source Software and assets (photos, hdri, music, rigs, etc.) that can be used in a CGI production with few or no copyright restrictions.

Free/Libre and Open Source Software is not _freeware_, it’s not software distributed for free (gratis). If you need some more info about what Free/Libre and Open Source Software is all about, please check the [Wikipedia article about “Free Software”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) and visit the [Free Software Foundation website](http://www.fsf.org/).

We created this project because we believe that Free Culture and Free/Libre Software are important issues in the contemporary CGI scene. Why? Well, this is not the place to write about it but the following quotes are good clues!

###### Richard M. Stallman
> Free software’ is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of ‘free’ as in ‘free speech,’ not as in ‘free beer’.


###### Ton Roosendaal
> Free culture is about doing it.



###### Albert Camus
> Without freedom, no art; art lives only on the restraints it imposes on itself, and dies of all others.




Not all suggested projects have the same level of sophistication and development. Some are developed by companies, others by individuals. Some are developed for profit, others by volunteers. We list the ones that are or can be useful, it’s your job to try them and choose.

The directory also provides a list of websites where you can find assets (3D models, photos, HDRI, sounds, etc.) that might be useful for animation movie production. Not all the websites and resources use the same licenses (in some cases, some restrictions may apply) but they should all be accessible free-of-charge (free as in gratis) and can be used for personal and commercial projects.

Have fun!
