Libre Pipeline for Animation is a project of [Animaxion Studioz](http://www.animaxionstudioz.com/).

This directory was created with the purpose of sharing Free/Libre and Open Source Software and assets (photos, hdri, music, rigs, etc.) that can be used in an animation production with few or no copyright restrictions.

Free/Libre and Open Source Software is not _freeware_, it’s not software distributed for free (gratis). If you need some more info about what Free/Libre and Open Source Software is all about, please check the [Wikipedia article about “Free Software”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) and visit the [Free Software Foundation website](http://www.fsf.org/).

> Free software’ is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of ‘free’ as in ‘free speech,’ not as in ‘free beer’.

###### Richard M. Stallman

We created this project because we believe that Free Culture and Free/Libre Software are important issues in the contemporary animation production scene. Why? Well, this is not the place to write about it but the following quotes are good clues ![😉](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png)

> Free culture is about doing it.

###### Ton Roosendaal

> Without freedom, no art; art lives only on the restraints it imposes on itself, and dies of all others.

###### Albert Camus

> Animation is an art. That is how I conceived it. But as I see, what you fellows have done with it, is making it into a trade. Not an art, but a trade. _Bad Luck!_

Not all suggested projects have the same level of sophistication and development. Some are developed by companies, others by individuals. Some are developed for profit, others by volunteers. We list the ones that are or can be useful, it’s your job to try them and choose.

The directory also provides a list of websites where you can find assets (3D models, photos, HDRI, sounds, etc.) that might be useful for animation movie production. Not all the websites and resources use the same licenses (in some cases, some restrictions may apply) but they should all be accessible free-of-charge (free as in gratis) and can be used for personal and commercial projects.

Have fun!
